    "TensorFlow allows us to perform specific machine learning number-crunching operations like derivatives on huge matricies with large efficiency. We can also easily distribute this processing across our CPU cores, GPU cores, or even multiple devices like multiple GPUs. Tensor, in TensorFlow is an array-like object, and, similar to an array it can hold matrix, vector, and even a scalar. In this tutorial we'll work with MNIST dataset. MNIST is a simple computer vision dataset. It consists of images of handwritten digits like the image below. We will then train a deep neural network on the training set using TensorFlow and make predictions on a test set.\n",
