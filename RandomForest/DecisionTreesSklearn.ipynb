    "\n",
    "The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -- we first construct the tree with historical data, and then use it to predict an outcome. One of the major advantages of decision trees is that they can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in the data that linear regression can't.\n",

    "The data is income data from the 1994 census, and contains information on an individual's marital status, age, type of work, and more. The target column, or what we want to predict, is whether individuals make less than or equal to 50k a year, or more than 50k a year.\n",
