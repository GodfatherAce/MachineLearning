    "# Natural Language Processing on Hacker News Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is the study of enabling computers to understand human languages. This field may involve teaching computers to automatically score essays, infer grammatical rules, or determine the emotions associated with text.  In this project we will employ NLP on Hacker News data. Hacker News is a community where users can submit articles, and other users can upvote those articles. The articles with the most upvotes make it to the front page, where they're more visible to the community. We'll be predicting the number of upvotes the articles received, based on their headlines. Because upvotes are an indicator of popularity, we'll discover which types of articles tend to be the most popular.\n",

There are two kinds of features that will reduce prediction accuracy. Features that occur only a few times will cause overfitting, because the model doesn't have enough information to accurately decide whether they're important. These features will probably correlate differently with upvotes in the test set and the training set.\n",

Because the errors are squared, MSE penalizes errors further away from the actual value more than those close to the actual value.
