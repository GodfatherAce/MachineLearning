A Naive Bayes classifier works by figuring out how likely data attributes are to be associated with a certain class. Naive Bayes model is easy to build and particularly useful for very large data sets. Along with simplicity, Naive Bayes is known to outperform even highly sophisticated classification methods.\n",
